wristband if that's okay can you tell me
when your birthday is
21st of july 19th
and your hospital number is
five two which 00156952 decision that's
great we'll see you could do anything
for two o'clock
so you've got one medication that should
do okay and that's called amoxicillin
it's a liquid medication it's an
antibiotic haven't had it before
it's been prescribed because you've got
a chest infection so to treat that chest

okay
i've checked the full patient's identity
hospital unit number
and the date of birth or matches the
prescription chart i've got a prescriber
signature
the patient's confirmed they've got no
allergies at all
so the drug is amoxicillin oral
suspension to be given for a chest
infection
the dose is 500 milligrams to be given
orally
the start date is today and we've got a
prescriber signature which matches the
one in the front
if i look at two o'clock it hasn't been
signed for already and the patient's
confirmed they haven't had it already
for today
okay
so i've got amoxicillin oral suspension
which is amoxicillin oil suspension
that's prescribed on the chart
250 milligrams in five milliliters and
we need 500
milligrams so i'm going to give 10
milliliters for the right dose
for all use only expires 12 20 23
and it says shaped before use
i'm going to use an all medication
syringe one of the purple ones
so the expiry date on this is 2024 and i
have to see the packaging's all intact

medication with you and
